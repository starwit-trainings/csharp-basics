# Chapter 02 - C# Language introduction
Learning a programming language is in some aspects similar to learning a foreign language. One need grammar and a minimal list of words, to express anything useful. So this chapter will teach you the basic syntax of C#. Each concept is introduced by a separate example. It is recommended, to open each example in your favourite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio or VSCode).

# Examples
All examples in this chapter are command line programs. So there is no graphical output and focus is on programatic concepts. 

## 01 - Variables and Data, constants
This example introduces a first insight, on how to store data in C# programs. 

### Tasks

## 02 - Control Flow
Making decisions is an obvious feature, that a programming language needs. So this example shows you, how to use decisions and loops to structure your software.

### Tasks

## 03 - Operators
Calculating results is another important building block, to write software. How to work with operators is thus the topic of this example.

### Tasks

## 04 - On type conversion
As C# is a statically typed language, dealing with converting types, is a necessity. For example storing text based user input into to proper variables and converting the various primitive types into each other are common tasks. Another helpful concept are implicit types - in many cases, the C# compiler can infer which type to use.

### Tasks

## 05 - Working with date and time
It is obvious, that dealing with date and time data is also an important task. If you know the right tools, it is however not a difficult task. This example shows you how to work with date and time data.

### Tasks

## 06 - Methods, Parameters and structuring your code
At this point it has become clear, that software is composed of a lot of source code. Thus in this example, we will learn how to use methods. It is a first tool to break down larger software into smaller, easier to maintaining components. 

### Tasks

## 07 - On commenting and documenting your code
Comments and documentation are an essential part of software development. So there are language features, tools and best practices. This example shall give you guidance, when to use comments and how to take advantage of tools in the C# eco-system.
