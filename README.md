# Introduction to the C# programming language
This repository contains examples and explanations that shall help you, learning the C# language. You can use anyting in this repository to study on your own or to teach your students. Please license comment down below.

## Repo Structure

### 01 Setup & Tools
This section introduces how to setup a C# project, how to build and how to run it. For more details and tasks see the section's [readme](01-setup/Readme.md).

### 02 Language introduction
After the very first steps this chapter will make you familiar with C#'s basic syntax and features. Please do not skip this section, if you haven't done any programming so far. More can be found [here](02-language-intro/Readme.md).

### 03 Introduction to object oriented development
C# is an object oriented language and that concept is deeply integrated in almost every aspect. So this section will explain what objects and classes are and how you can use them, to model whatever is necessary for your software and to break down large problem domains into maintainable code modules. Cee the [chapter's readme](03-objection-orientation/Readme.md) for more details.

### 04 Using libraries in C#
A very important aspect of software development is, to use libraries. In any realistic software project, dozens if not hundreds of libraries are used, to implement functions you need. Integrating libraries in your development projects, will be introduced in this chapter. Examples and more details can be found [here](04-libraries/Readme.md).

### 05 Advanced language features
All modern programming languages have a number of features and tools, that address every day problems. This section is a collection of those features. If dealing with exceptions or using unit tests - this section provides examples for each of those concepts. As always, look into the section's [readme file](05-advanced-language-features/Readme.md) for more details. 

### 06 Real World Examples
After introducing the various aspects of the C# programming language, this section contains a number of real world examples. This means here you find a number of projects, that can be used to start developing real programs, ranging from native user interface to web applications. List of examples and tasks can be found [here](06-real-world-example/Readme.md).
